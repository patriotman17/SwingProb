# Determining Swing Probability of MLB players

The data set I used was three csv files which had year 1, 2, and 3 seasonal data for MLB players. My goal for the project is to be give a swing probability for all pitches in the year 3 dataset. 
The dataset and documentation can be accessed here: https://app.box.com/s/pf4uz7xbj6cfbggo0anq2f9atmg46m4w
